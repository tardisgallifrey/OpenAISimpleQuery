# A simple API query of OpenAI in Java

<p>This is my first attempt at writing an Http API.  I am
using OpenAI as my API.  It runs reasonably reliably from 
the command line in a jar file.</p>

<p>The jar file is in the main app folder if you just wish 
to use the output.</p>

<p>This project will be updated as time permits.  It is not 
written well.  All the real code is in the main class.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this app came from [Coding John's video 
on Http API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oq7Y8n1t00&t=870s)</p>

<p>This app required an OpenAI API key to be set up as an 
environment variable.  You will have to obtain one and set it up.</p>

<p>OpenAI's answers are not always reliable.  I have not written code 
to let OpenAI know that yet.</p>

<p>This was built in Intellij Idea on Redhat Linux.</p>
